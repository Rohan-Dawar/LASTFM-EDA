# LASTFM-EDA

# This repo contains the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) of my last.fm exploratory data analysis (LFM-EDA).
# The .ipynb requires a lastfm API key to run, and fetches all tracks and artist information from my last.fm page.
# The API functionality itself can be run using the LastFM-API-GetTracks.py file, all it needs is the API key and lastfm username, it will generate the alltracks csv and the combine (artist metadata) csv.
