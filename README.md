# LASTFM-EDA

# This repo contains the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) of my last.fm exploratory data analysis (LFM-EDA).
# The .ipynb requires a lastfm API key to run, and fetches all tracks and artist information from my last.fm page.
## Plotly graphs may not render in GitHub's Jupyter Notebook viewer. If you cannot see the plotly graphs, you can see the notebook on my [Jovian page here](https://jovian.ai/rohan-dawar/rohan-dawar-jztdsp2-lastfm-eda2).
# The API functionality itself can be run using the LastFM-API-GetTracks.py file, all it needs is the API key and lastfm username, it will generate the alltracks csv and the combine (artist metadata) csv.
